Modelling and Simulation using MATLAB


#About this course
##Course Summary

Modelling and simulation make a particular part of the world easier to define, visualize and understand. Both require the identification of relevant aspects of a situation in the real world and then the use of different types of models for different objectives and the definition of the most suitable model parameters.

This course provides to you a number of methods suitable for modelling technical systems and processes in a wide range of applications. These applications cover a range from image processing via machine learning to face recognition.

After introducing the techniques in general, you train their application to real problems employing the widely used modelling and simulation tool MATLAB®.

What will I learn?

You will be acquainted with the concepts of modelling and simulation
You will be able to implement and simulate models using MATLAB®.
You will acquire further knowledge of Image Processing, Optical Character Recognition, Machine Learning and Face Recognition.
If you are an enthusiastic student with only rudimentary programming knowledge you can acquire an understanding of basic MATLAB® programming.
What do I have to know?

The course will be taught on an academic level for undergraduate students. Therefore, mathematics and physics knowledge of at least secondary education level as well as programming knowledge is a prerequisite. MATLAB® is commercial software. As a result of support from MathWorks, students will be granted a downloadable license to MATLAB® for the duration of the course.
